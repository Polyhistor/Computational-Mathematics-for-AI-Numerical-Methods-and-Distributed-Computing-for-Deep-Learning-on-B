  abstract = {The growing attention on location-based services has promoted the development of indoor localization studies. Existing techniques mainly use Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of wireless signals as location fingerprint. Inspired by deep learning techniques for signal processing, we propose a deep neural network-based framework (DeepLoc) to implement Wi-Fi fingerprint positioning. In order to improve localization performance, we further design a network division based optimization algorithm. We first adopt greedy algorithm to locate the user in a sub-area, and then reconstruct a smaller fingerprint database, which is fed into the training model. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework. Experimental results show that DeepLoc can improve the localization accuracy efficiently and obtain better performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The increase of the spatial resolution in numerical computation always leads to a decrease in computing efficiency with respect to the constraint of mesh density. In response to this problem of the inability to perform numerical computation, we propose a novel method to boost the mesh-density in the finite element method (FEM) within 2D domains. Running on the von Mises stress fields of the 2D plane-strain problems computed by FEM, the proposed method utilizes a deep neural network named SMNet to learn a nonlinear mapping from low mesh-density to high mesh-density in stress fields and realizes the improvement of numerical computation accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. By introducing residual density blocks into SMNet, we can extract abundant local features and improve prediction capacity. The result indicates that SMNet can effectively increase the spatial resolution of stress fields under multiple scaling factors in mesh-density: 2 {\texttimes}, 3 {\texttimes}, and 4 {\texttimes}. Compared with the targets, the relative error of SMNet is 1.67\%, showing better performance than many other methods. SMNet can be generically used as an enhanced mesh-density boosting model of 2D physical fields for mesh-based numerical methods.},

With the development of deep learning technology and the rise of big data, the resource optimization algorithm encounters a series of challenges, such as the workload imbalance and low resource utilization. To address the preceding problems, this study proposes a novel resource optimization algorithm based on clustering and an improved differential evolution strategy (Multi-objective Task Scheduling Strategy (MTSS)). Three indexes, namely task completion time, execution cost, and workload, of virtual machines are selected and used to build the fitness function of the MTSS algorithm. At the same time, the preprocessing state is set up to cluster according to the resource and task characteristics to reduce the magnitude of their matching scale. Moreover, to solve the workload imbalance among different resource sets, local resource tasks are reallocated using the Q-value method in the MTSS strategy to achieve workload balance of global resources and improve the resource utilization rate. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of task completion time, execution cost, and workload balancing.},

Infected and uninfected cases around the world have contributed to a growing dataset, which is publicly available and can be used by artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict the confirmed cases of Monkeypox at an early stage. Motivated by this, we propose in this paper a new approach for accurate prediction of the Monkeypox confirmed cases based on an optimized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep network. To fine-tune the hyper-parameters of the LSTM-based deep network, we employed the Al-Biruni Earth Radius (BER) optimization algorithm; thus, the proposed approach is denoted by BER-LSTM. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach when assessed using various evaluation criteria, such as Mean Bias Error, which is recorded as (0.06) using BER-LSTM. To prove the superiority of the proposed approach, six different machine learning models are included in the conducted experiments. In addition, four different optimization algorithms are considered for comparison purposes. The results of this comparison confirmed the superiority of the proposed approach. On the other hand, several statistical tests are applied to analyze the stability and significance of the proposed approach. These tests include one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Wilcoxon, and regression tests. The results of these tests emphasize the robustness, significance, and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Advancement in river flow prediction systems can greatly empower the operational river management to make better decisions, practices, and policies. Machine learning methods recently have shown promising results in building accurate models for river flow prediction. This paper aims to identify models with higher accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability by inspecting the accuracy of a number of machine learning models. The proposed models for river flow include support vector regression (SVR), a hybrid of SVR with a fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) (so-called FOASVR), and an M5 model tree (M5). Additionally, the influence of periodicity ({$\pi$}) on the forecasting enactment was examined. To assess the performance of the proposed models, different statistical meters were implemented, including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Results showed that the FOASVR with RMSE (4.36 and 6.33 m3/s), MAE (2.40 and 3.71 m3/s) and R (0.82 and 0.81) values had the best performance in forecasting river flows at Babarud and Vaniar stations, respectively. Also, regarding BIC parameters, Qt-1 and {$\pi$} were selected as parsimonious inputs for predicting river flow one month ahead. Overall findings indicated that, although both the FOASVR and M5 predicted the river flows in suitable accordance with observed river flows, the performance of the FOASVR was moderately better than the M5 and periodicity noticeably increased the performance of the models; consequently, FOASVR can be suggested as the most accurate method for forecasting river flows.},

It helps identify problems before they occur and re-allocate resources before they are wasted. Although deep learning (DL) has yielded breakthroughs, most existing approaches build on classical machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly when it comes to outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring. This circumstance reflects a lack of understanding about which event log properties facilitate the use of DL techniques. To address this gap, the authors compared the performance of DL (i.e., simple feedforward deep neural networks and long short term memory networks) and ML techniques (i.e., random forests and support vector machines) based on five publicly available event logs. It could be observed that DL generally outperforms classical ML techniques. Moreover, three specific propositions could be inferred from further observations: First, the outperformance of DL techniques is particularly strong for logs with a high variant-to-instance ratio (i.e., many non-standard cases). Second, DL techniques perform more stably in case of imbalanced target variables, especially for logs with a high event-to-activity ratio (i.e., many loops in the control flow). Third, logs with a high activity-to-instance payload ratio (i.e., input data is predominantly generated at runtime) call for the application of long short term memory networks. Due to the purposive sampling of event logs and techniques, these findings also hold for logs outside this study.},

  abstract = {Unstructured multimedia data (text and audio) provides unprecedented opportunities to derive actionable decision-making in the financial industry, in areas such as portfolio and risk management. However, due to formidable methodological challenges, the promise of business value from unstructured multimedia data has not materialized. In this study, we use a design science approach to develop DeepVoice, a novel nonverbal predictive analysis system for financial risk prediction, in the setting of quarterly earnings conference calls. DeepVoice forecasts financial risk by leveraging not only what managers say (verbal linguistic cues) but also how managers say it (vocal cues) during the earnings conference calls. The design of DeepVoice addresses several challenges associated with the analysis of nonverbal communication. We also propose a two-stage deep learning model to effectively integrate managers' sequential vocal and verbal cues. Using a unique dataset of 6,047 earnings call samples (audio recordings and textual transcripts) of S\&P 500 firms across four years, we show that DeepVoice yields remarkably lower risk forecast errors than that achieved by previous efforts. The improvement can also translate into nontrivial economic gains in options trading. The theoretical and practical implications of analyzing vocal cues are discussed.}

  abstract = {Summary             In the present epoch of computing, the world has changed from older conventional print media to social platform channels. Fake news articles have the prospects to handle the opinions of the public and so may harm human groupings. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the authenticity and credibility of the news flash being shared on the internet community. Hence, this research paper devises an efficient and robust fake news detection model, named Exponential Chimp Optimization Algorithm (EChOA)-based Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Network (DNFN) for detecting fake news. The introduced model utilizes a MapReduce framework that includes the mapper and reducer phases for processing big data for detecting fake news. First phase of processing is the Mapper work, in which every input used in the database is processed and creates an intermediate key-value pair. In the reducer phase, the fusion of features is performed by arranging the features with the help of computing the optimal parameter and Rand similarity coefficient using a Deep Q Network (DQN). Here, the detection of fake news is obtained by DNFN, and the DNFN is done using implemented EChOA. The EChOA-based DNFN effectively generates robust and effective fake news detection performance by choosing the optimal feature subsets through feature fusion. The EChOA is designed by integrating the Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA). Moreover, the EChOA-based DNFN method outperformed various former fake news detection approaches and attains the highest performance based on the testing accuracy is 0.909, sensitivity is 0.937, and specificity is 0.891 using the FakeNewsNet dataset.},

Within this framework, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to develop recommendation systems becomes essential. These systems are designed to identify students at risk of underperforming by analyzing patterns in their historical academic data, thereby facilitating personalized support strategies. This research introduces an innovative deep learning model tailored for pinpointing students in need of academic assistance. Utilizing a Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) architecture, the model is rich with features such as a dense layer, max-pooling layer, and the ADAM optimization method used to optimize performance. The effectiveness of this model was tested using a comprehensive dataset containing 15,165 records of student assessments collected across several academic institutions. A comparative analysis with existing educational recommendation models, like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), AdaBoost, and Artificial Immune Recognition System v2, highlights the superior accuracy of the proposed GRU model, which achieved an impressive overall accuracy of 99.70\%. This breakthrough underscores the model's potential in aiding educational institutions to proactively support students, thereby mitigating the risks of underachievement and dropout.},

Due to the significance of the early analysis of the thermal load in energy-efficient buildings, this work introduces and compares four novel optimizer techniques---the firefly algorithm (FA), optics-inspired optimization (OIO), shuffled complex evolution (SCE), and teaching--learning-based optimization (TLBO)---for an accurate prediction of the heating load (HL). The models are applied to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to surmount its computational shortcomings. The models are fed by a literature-based dataset obtained for residential buildings. The results revealed that all models used are capable of properly analyzing and predicting the HL pattern. A comparison between them, however, showed that the TLBO-MLP with the coefficients of determination 0.9610 vs. 0.9438, 0.9373, and 0.9556 (respectively, for FA-MLP, OIO-MLP, and SCE-MLP) and the root mean square error of 2.1103 vs. 2.5456, 2.7099, and 2.2774 presents the most reliable approximation of the HL. It also surpassed several methods used in previous studies. Thus, the developed TLBO-MLP can be a beneficial model for subsequent practical applications.},

This problem has been addressed mainly by discovering a prediction model by using traditional machine learning methods and, more recently, deep learning methods, exploiting the supervision coming from outcome-class labels associated with historical log traces. However, a supervised learning strategy is unsuitable for important application scenarios where the outcome labels are known only for a small fraction of log traces. In order to address these challenging scenarios, a semi-supervised learning approach is proposed here, which leverages a multi-target DNN model supporting both outcome prediction and the additional auxiliary task of next-activity prediction. The latter task helps the DNN model avoid spurious trace embeddings and overfitting behaviors. In extensive experimentation, this approach is shown to outperform both fully-supervised and semi-supervised discovery methods using similar DNN architectures across different real-life datasets and label-scarce settings.},

To mitigate these cyber threats, academia and industry have placed a significant focus on proactively identifying and labeling exploits developed by the international hacker community. However, prevailing approaches for labeling exploits in hacker forums do not leverage metadata from exploit darknet markets or public exploit repositories to enhance labeling performance. In this study, we adopted the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel information technology artifact, the deep transfer learning exploit labeler (DTL-EL). DTL-EL incorporates a pre-initialization design, multi-layer deep transfer learning (DTL), and a self-attention mechanism to automatically label exploits in hacker forums. We rigorously evaluated the proposed DTL-EL against state-of-the-art non-DTL benchmark methods based in classical machine learning and deep learning. Results suggest that the proposed DTL-EL significantly outperforms benchmark methods based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our proposed DTL-EL framework provides important practical implications for key stakeholders such as cybersecurity managers, analysts, and educators.}

To better manage chronic conditions, objective, convenient, and inexpensive wearable sensor- based information systems (IS) have been increasingly used by researchers and practitioners. However, existing models often focus on a single aspect of chronic conditions and are often ``black boxes'' with limited interpretability. In this research, we adopt the computational design science paradigm and propose a novel adversarial attention-based deep multisource multitask learning (AADMML) framework. Drawing upon deep learning, multitask learning, multisource learning, attention mechanism, and adversarial learning, AADMML addresses limitations with existing wearable sensor-based chronic condition severity assessment methods. Choosing Parkinson's disease (PD) as our test case because of its prevalence and societal significance, we conduct benchmark experiments to evaluate AADMML against state-of-the-art models on a large-scale dataset containing thousands of instances. We present three case studies to demonstrate the practical utility and economic benefits of AADMML and by applying it to detect early-stage PD. We discuss how our work is related to the IS knowledge base and its practical implications. This work can contribute to improved life quality for senior citizens and advance IS research in mobile health analytics.}

  abstract = {Ensuring the health and safety of senior citizens who live alone is a growing societal concern. The Activity of Daily Living (ADL) approach is a common means to monitor disease progression and the ability of these individuals to care for themselves. However, the prevailing sensor-based ADL monitoring systems primarily rely on wearable motion sensors, capture insufficient information for accurate ADL recognition, and do not provide a comprehensive understanding of ADLs at different granularities. Current healthcare IS and mobile analytics research focuses on studying the system, device, and provided services, and is in need of an end-to-end solution to comprehensively recognize ADLs based on mobile sensor data. This study adopts the design science paradigm and employs advanced deep learning algorithms to develop a novel hierarchical, multiphase ADL recognition framework to model ADLs at different granularities. We propose a novel 2D interaction kernel for convolutional neural networks to leverage interactions between human and object motion sensors. We rigorously evaluate each proposed module and the entire framework against state-of-the-art benchmarks (e.g., support vector machines, DeepConvLSTM, hidden Markov models, and topic-modeling-based ADLR) on two real-life motion sensor datasets that consist of ADLs at varying granularities: Opportunity and INTER. Results and a case study demonstrate that our framework can recognize ADLs at different levels more accurately. We discuss how stakeholders can further benefit from our proposed framework. Beyond demonstrating practical utility, we discuss contributions to the IS knowledge base for future design science-based cybersecurity, healthcare, and mobile analytics applications.}

Recently, research has gained traction, with various technological innovations, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, significantly influencing the design of PAS. Although recent studies highlight these developments, the rising trend focuses on broader implications, such as the synergies and delegation between systems and users in organizational decision-making environments. Against this backdrop, we utilized a systematic literature review of 262 articles to build on this evolving perspective. Guided by general systems theory and socio-technical thinking, the concept of an information systems artifact directed this review. Our first objective was to clarify the essential subsystems, identifying 23 constituent components of PAS. Subsequently, we delved into the meta-level design of PAS, emphasizing the synergy and delegation between the human decision-maker and prescriptive analytics in supporting organizational decisions. From this exploration, four distinct system archetypes emerged: advisory, executive, adaptive, and self-governing PAS. Lastly, we engaged with affordance theory, illuminating the action potential of PAS. Our study advances the perspective on PAS, specifically from a broader socio-technical and information systems viewpoint, highlighting six distinct research directions, acting as a launchpad for future research in the domain.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, load forecasting is used by power companies to balance energy demand and supply. Among the several load forecasting methods, medium-term load forecasting is necessary for grid's maintenance planning, settings of electricity prices, and harmonizing energy sharing arrangement. The forecasting of the month ahead electrical loads provides the information required for the interchange of energy among power companies. For accurate load forecasting, this paper proposes a model for medium-term load forecasting that uses hourly electrical load and temperature data to predict month ahead hourly electrical loads. For data preprocessing, modified entropy mutual information-based feature selection is used. It eliminates the redundancy and irrelevancy of features from the data. We employ the conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) for the load forecasting. A meta-heuristic optimization algorithm Jaya is used to improve the CRBM's accuracy rate and convergence. In addition, the consumers' dynamic consumption behaviors are also investigated using a discrete-time Markov chain and an adaptive k-means is used to group their behaviors into clusters. We evaluated the proposed model using GEFCom2012 US utility dataset. Simulation results confirm that the proposed model achieves better accuracy, fast convergence, and low execution time as compared to other existing models in the literature.},

The GOA, WDO, and BBO algorithms are mixed with a class of feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs), which is called a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict the HL and CL. According to the sensitivity analysis, the WDO with swarm size = 500 proposes the most-fitted ANN. The proposed WDO-ANN provided an accurate prediction in terms of heating load (training (R2 correlation = 0.977 and RMSE error = 0.183) and testing (R2 correlation = 0.973 and RMSE error = 0.190)) and yielded the best-fitted prediction in terms of cooling load (training (R2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.147) and testing (R2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.148)).},

The DANE algorithm is an approximate Newtonian method that has been widely used in communication-efficient distributed machine learning. It has the advantages of fast convergence and no need to calculate the inverse of the Hessian matrix, which can significantly reduce the communication and computational overhead in high-dimensional situations. In order to further improve the computational efficiency, it is necessary to study how to speed up the local optimization of DANE. It is a feasible method to choose to use the most popular adaptive gradient optimization algorithm Adam to replace the commonly used stochastic gradient descent method to solve the local single-machine suboptimization problem of DANE. Experiments show that Adam-based optimization can converge significantly faster than the original SGD-based implementation with little sacrifice in model generalization performance. With the increase of sampling rate, DANE-Adam significantly outperforms the DANE method in terms of convergence speed, and at the same time, the accuracy can be kept almost unchanged, which are 0.96, 0.88 and 0.75, respectively. This shows that Adam-based optimization can converge significantly faster than the original SGD-based implementation with little sacrifice in model generalization performance, with significant potential value.},

The Industry 4.0 era has built a wide acceptance for the predictive maintenance techniques in the remaining useful life (RUL) estimation of critical industrial systems. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional-LSTM (bi-LSTM) deep neural architecture-based predictive algorithms are proposed for the RUL estimation of the lathe spindle unit. The deep learning algorithm is embedded within a Bayesian optimization algorithm for the self-optimization of its network structure and hyperparameters. The proposed deep learning algorithm is trained using lathe spindle health degradation data collected from an experimental accelerated run-to-failure test rig to evolve an RUL prediction model. The vibration signals representing lathe spindle health degradation from the health to faulty state are analyzed to extract time, frequency, and time-frequency domain features, which are then subjected to a neighborhood component analysis (NCA) based feature selection criteria. Finally, the selected relevant features are used to train the optimized LSTM/bi-LSTM network for RUL estimation. A comparison of the prediction results for Bayesian optimized LSTM/bi-LSTM network architectures and other prominent data-driven approaches are performed. The Bayesian optimized LSTM + bi-LSTM deep network architecture is observed to have the highest prediction accuracy for lathe spindle RUL estimation.}

  abstract = {With the rapid development of sensor technology, structural health monitoring data have tended to become more massive. Deep learning has advantages when handling big data, and has therefore been widely researched for diagnosing structural anomalies. However, for the diagnosis of different structural abnormalities, the model hyperparameters need to be adjusted according to different application scenarios, which is a complicated process. In this paper, a new strategy for building and optimizing 1D-CNN models is proposed that is suitable for diagnosing damage to different types of structure. This strategy involves optimizing hyperparameters with the Bayesian algorithm and improving model recognition accuracy using data fusion technology. Under the condition of sparse sensor measurement points, the entire structure is monitored, and the high-precision diagnosis of structural damage is performed. This method improves the applicability of the model to different structure detection scenarios, and avoids the shortcomings of traditional hyperparameter adjustment methods based on experience and subjectivity. In preliminary research on the simply supported beam test case, the efficient and accurate identification of parameter changes in small local elements was achieved. Furthermore, publicly available structural datasets were utilized to verify the robustness of the method, and a high identification accuracy rate of 99.85\% was achieved. Compared with other methods described in the literature, this strategy shows significant advantages in terms of sensor occupancy rate, computational cost, and identification accuracy.},

Visual similarity between benign and malignant nodules, heterogeneity and low contrast variation are the factors that make accurate cancerous lesion recognition, a very challenging task. In this paper, Optimized Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and Fuzzy C-means with Equilibrium optimizer (FCM-EO) is proposed for classification and segmentation of CT lung images. The proposed architecture is comprised of four phases such as preprocessing, feature extraction, classification and segmentation. In preprocessing, the weighted mean histogram analysis (WMHA) is utilized to enhance the quality of images and noise removal. Hybrid Dual tree-complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) with Gabor filter is proposed in feature extraction to extract the features from the preprocessed images. DCNN model is designed to classify the original images into benign and malignant images. The weight of DCNN model is updated using the Enhanced black widow optimization algorithm (EBWOA). In segmentation, FCM-EO is introduced to identify the tumor regions and remove the outliers from the malignant images. LIDC-IDRI dataset is utilized for the experimental analysis and MATLAB is the implementation tool. The simulation analysis is performed for both the classification and segmentation processes. Accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F-measure, FROC, DSC, MCC, and IoU are evaluated for both these processes. The experimental results showed the proposed framework is efficient for the identification of tumor from the CT lung images.},

  abstract = {Deep learning solutions in big data applications can benefit cloud centres and can also lead to network communication overhead. Typically, data collected from traffic are sent to the traffic management centre for analysis. However, this process can worsen the network route to the traffic management centre. A two-tier mechanism has been developed to address this issue, which performs vehicle speed estimation and traffic congestion detection for efficient traffic management. The real-time traffic video data are captured and the video frames are initially processed through a foreground extraction process, which extracts the temporarily stopped vehicles on the road by removing background pixels from the frames. The video frames are then wrapped in an up-down view to remove the influence of the observation angle. The traffic congestion is then detected accurately based on the traffic characteristics using the proposed Ensemble Random Forest-based Gradient Optimization (ERF-GO) algorithm. The generalization error occurs when learning complex features on frames is minimized using a gradient-based optimization (GO) algorithm. Finally, the learned information on traffic conditions is forwarded to the cloud and edge computing environments based on network connection speed. The efficiency of the proposed ERF-GO is investigated in terms of performance metrics, namely root mean square error, speed detection error, execution time, computational cost, accuracy, latency, workload balance, precision, recall, f-measure, and congestion detection error rate. The analytic result displays that the proposed ERF-GO algorithm attains a greater accuracy rate of about 98.65\% in detecting traffic congestion which is comparably higher than state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Online health communities (OHCs) play an important role in enabling patients to exchange information and obtain social support from each other. However, do OHC interactions always benefit patients? In this research, we investigate different mechanisms by which OHC content may affect patients' emotions. Specifically, we notice users can read not only emotional support intended to help them but also emotional support targeting other persons or posts that are not intended to generate any emotional support (auxiliary content). Drawing from emotional contagion theories, we argue that even though emotional support may benefit targeted support seekers, it could have a negative impact on the emotions of other support seekers. Our empirical study on an OHC for depression patients supports these arguments. Our findings are new to the literature and have critical practical implications since they suggest that we should carefully manage OHC-based interventions for depression patients to avoid unintended consequences. We design a novel deep learning model to differentiate emotional support from auxiliary content. Such differentiation is critical for identifying the negative effect of emotional support on unintended recipients.
